# Persons Of Interest

Persons Of Interest(POI for short) is a python system that is built to help gather intelligence on suspicious individuals by means of profile building.

# Versions

There are Two versions of this system! There is a Local version and a remote version.
1.the remote version is for those who have top secret intel or highly sensitive targets that they are building intelligence on(the ideal usage) and cannot risk that data getting out.
2. the local version is for those who have less sensitive data and stealth isn't really a huge issue. If there isn't a chance that your targets could access your equipment physically this is the version you would want to use.

# User experience
 
Persons Of Interest has a GUI version(Graphical User Interface) and A command line operated version for those of you who like quick operations. The command line version offers GUI data visualization (since viewing data on the command line isn't too idea).
